This is a sample React app that displays data from an array of JSON objects on to a google material-ui list view.
It also offers add/edit/delete and pagination features.

To view the working of this sample app, do the following:

cd ~/listViewApp/public
npm i
npm start

It should open up a browser window at "localhost:3000/home", which should display the list view.
